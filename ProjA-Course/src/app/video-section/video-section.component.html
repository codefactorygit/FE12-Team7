        Designed by Google in 2009, Angular JS has become one of the most
        popular JavaScript frameworks so far as it is easy to use, provides high
        simplification to the entire development process as well as supports the
        latest standards of JavaScript (ES6). Over the years, it has become one
        of the most refined frameworks to create web and mobile apps that is
        modular as well as responsive.
